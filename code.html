            <label for="Noel">I think that junk food is amazing to have once in while. I do not think one should
                have junk food all the time because of the possibility of becoming seriously ill and spoiling the
                health. To always be helthy, you should not eat these junk foods which will affect the rest of your
                health. One way of helping you to stop getting addicted to junk food is to eat healthy snacks wich will
                have a good impact on you rather than junk foods that could damage your health which could lead to
                problems that are more fatal and more important.</label>
